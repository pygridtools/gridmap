GridMap
==============================

A package to allow you to easily create jobs on the cluster directly from
Python. You can directly map Python functions onto the cluster without needing
to write any wrapper code yourself.

This is the ETS fork of an older project called PythonGrid. Unlike the older
version, it is Python 2/3 compatible.

For some examples of how to use it, check out ``map_reduce.py`` (for a simple
example of how you can map a function onto the cluster) and ``manual.py`` (for
an example of how you can create list of jobs yourself) in the examples folder.
