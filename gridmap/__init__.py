GridMap provides wrappers that simplify submission and collection of jobs,
in a more 'pythonic' fashion.

:var USE_MEM_FREE: Does your cluster support specifying how much memory a job
                   will use via mem_free? (Default: ``False``)
:var DEFAULT_QUEUE: The default job scheduling queue to use.
                    (Default: ``all.q``)
:var CREATE_PLOTS: Should we plot cpu and mem usage and send via email?
                   (Default: ``True``)
:var SEND_ERROR_MAILS: Should we send error emails?
                       (Default: ``True``)
:var SMTP_SERVER: SMTP server for sending error emails.
                  (Default: last three sections of the current machine's fully
                  qualified domain name)
:var ERROR_MAIL_SENDER: Sender address to use for error emails.
                        (Default: ``error@gridmap.py``)
:var ERROR_MAIL_RECIPIENT: Recipient address for error emails.
                           (Default: $USER@$HOST, where $USER is the current
                           user's username, and $HOST is the last two sections
                           of the current machine's fully qualified domain name,
                           or just the hostname if it does not contain periods.)
:var MAX_TIME_BETWEEN_HEARTBEATS: How long should we wait (in seconds) for a
                                  heartbeat before we consider a job dead?
                                  (Default: 90)
:var IDLE_THRESHOLD: Percent CPU utilization (ratio of CPU time to real time
                     * 100) that a process must drop below to be considered not
                     running.
                     (Default: 1.0)
:var MAX_IDLE_HEARTBEATS: Number of heartbeats we can receive where the process
                          has >= IDLE_THRESHOLD CPU utilization and is sleeping
                          before we consider the process dead. (Default: 3)
:var NUM_RESUBMITS: How many times can a particular job can die, before we give
                    up. (Default: 3)
:var CHECK_FREQUENCY: How many seconds pass before we check on the status of a
                      particular job in seconds. (Default: 15)
:var HEARTBEAT_FREQUENCY: How many seconds pass before jobs on the cluster send
                          back heart beats to the submission host.
                          (Default: 10)
