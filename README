pythongrid - a high level front end to DRMAA-python
===================================================

.. contents::

Introduction
============
The module pythongrid.py provides wrappers that simplify 
submission and collection of jobs, in a more 'pythonic' fashion.
It also uses the same interface for running jobs locally on the
same machine using threads. This may be useful for debugging purposes,
and may also be faster if the cluster is busy and the jobs are small.

Installation
============

Dependencies
------------

- `DRMAA-python`_ (>=0.2.2)
- `easysvm`_  (>=0.2) [optional, used in example]

.. _`DRMAA-python`: http://gridengine.sunsource.net/howto/drmaa_python.html
.. _`easysvm` : http://www.easysvm.org


Install
-------

DRMAA-python is required. To check that it is available

    >>> import DRMAA

Untar the archive, and put pythongrid.py somewhere in $PYTHONPATH

    $ tar xzvf pythongrid-0.1.tar.gz

Edit pythongrid.py to set the following two variables at the top.

    PYGRID = '/absolute/path/to/pythongrid.py'
    TEMPDIR = '/absolute/path/to/inputoutputdir/'

PYGRID is used on the cluster as a shell command.
TEMPDIR should be readable and writable from both submission
and cluster systems.

Edit your environment such that the drmaa shared library for the grid
engine is in the shared path. For example

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/sge/lib/lx26-amd64/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

To check that everything has installed properly

    >>> import pythongrid



Usage
=====

Four functions wrap the complexity:

- submitJobs takes a list of jobs and sends them to the cluster
- getStatus checks the jobs in a given session
- collectJobs takes a list of job ids and collects their results
- processJobs provides a shortcut that does both in series. It also
  provides an option to run locally.

Please look at the examples for usage details.

To use a function within the module itself, one has to import the
module explicitly from within the module. This is to resolve
namespaces in python
